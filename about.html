                        Life is purposeful when it has all the essentials. But sadly, some people are still devoid of many basic amenities of life. We the volunteers of SARATHI try to reach out to those people who need help and our approach comes with an idea of making their lives a bit better. The meals campaign that recently came from ASSAM DAILY as an initiative of providing free meals to poor people is supported by our group. In a legal and fair way, we decided to raise funds regarding the programme so that more people can understand about it and more hungry souls can finally sleep without being hungry. Your contribution will always be remembered. So here we are SARATHI have started a donation drive.

                       <img src="post.jpg" width="500" height="600"><br>
                       <i>On 27th July, 2020, SARATHI started a 15 days campaign for 50 meals which was an initiative by ASSAM DAILY. When we started this campaign, our motive was not only to generate enough funds but to leave the imprints of the impact upon how hunger is the major problem prevailing in the entire world and we need to raise our voice towards it.
                        Yesterday, we successfully ended with our campaign. With all your support and our hard-work we collected â‚¹20,612. We cannot express our gratitude and appreciation towards you all through words as it would be less enough to do so. We are grateful to have the support of people like you. World needs more people like you. Because of you all we were able to bring 1% change in the society. And hopefully with all your support we shall continue to do such noble works for the society.
                        Thank you for all your love and support towards a better cause   
                        ~ TEAM SARATHI
